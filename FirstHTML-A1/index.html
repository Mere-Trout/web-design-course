        My name is Jesse and I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science.
        <br>
        I love to do a number of things like playing videogames, working on cars, and read books.
        <br>
        But if theres one thing that I love to do most its riding motorcycles.
        <br>
        I have included a picture of a motorcycle I want to get in the near feature.
