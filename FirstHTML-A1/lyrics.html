Lie to me, taint everything
You coddle me in every need
Fall from me in memory
These magazines tell everything
You did
How do you even stand it?
I'll never get a chance, no understanding, yeah
Why?
The sight of a cold sheet standing
I think it's kinda deadly and romantic, yeah
Oh, oh
You did it, you did it (I know it)
Police told me
That you wouldn't do it
That you wouldn't go
You did
How do you even stand it?
I'll never get a chance, no understanding, yeah
Why?
The sight of a cold sheet standing
I think it's kinda deadly and romantic, yeah
Call for me, call
The lead inside
The bullet and casing, homicide
Run
The sight of a cold sheet standing
I think it's kinda deadly and romantic, yeah
Lie to me, taint everything
You coddle me in every need
